- Docker Registry : universal app distribution (DokerHub), stores docker images and facilitates their distribution. Able to take the software made on one machine with all of its dependencies and run it exactly the same way on another system (with possibly a different distribution).

- Docker Container : Identical runtime environments, isolates applications, prevents the application running on a container from seeing the rest of the operating system (similar to a VM).
